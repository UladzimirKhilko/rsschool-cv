## ** _About me_ **
***
At 53, I decided to try my hand at frontend development. I have been taking various online courses on Udemy for over a year. Since November 2021, I have been working on a small project as a developer. I really enjoy the application development process. I love getting new knowledge. I take the learning process very seriously. Taking these courses is a challenge to yourself...
